HTTP Live Streaming (also known as HLS) is an HTTP-based adaptive bitrate streaming communications protocol developed by Apple Inc. and released in 2009. Support for the protocol is widespread in media players, web browsers, mobile devices, and streaming media servers. As of 2019, an annual video industry survey has consistently found it to be the most popular streaming format.

A file with the M3U8 file extension is a UTF-8 encoded playlist file. M3U8 files are plain text files that can be used to store the URL paths of streaming audio or video and information about the media tracks. VIVE Sync supports the M3U8 file format for playing streaming 360Â° videos.
